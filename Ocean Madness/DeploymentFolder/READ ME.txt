Controls:
	Arrow keys - Move/Aim/Sail
	Space - activate item
	X - shoot cannon ball
	Z - shoot chain shot
	Esc - close game


Known issues:
	about 30% of the time, the lights load oddly, this is a visual bug and does not affect the gameplay.
	if the player model falls outside the boat you cannot get back onto the boat.

	if any issues come up, just restart the game to fix it. 

	I don't know why those problems come up, when developing it didn't happen in Debug, it was only once
	I built it in Release mode that problems came up.
